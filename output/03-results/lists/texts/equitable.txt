"1" "the § 301 issue, how ever, is comparable to a breach of contract claim—a legal issue.7                 28       respondents' action against the union thus encompasses both equitable and legal issues."
"2" "an individual who establishes a cause of action under § 1981 is entitled to both equitable and legal relief, including compensatory and, under certain circumstances, punitive damages."
"3" "22       it is the opinion of this court that the decree of the circuit court ought to be reversed and annulled, and the cause remanded with directions to take an account of rents and profits which have been or might have been received by the defendant on the houses which have been completed by morris and nicholson on the twenty lots in the proceedings mentioned; and also to take an account of the money with interest thereon, which was demandable by the defendant on each unimproved lot; and that an issue, to be tried either in alexandria or washington, be directed to ascertain what damages have been sustained by the houses built by morris and nicholson previous to the 6th of may, 1797, whether finished or unfinished, on those lots which shall be decreed to be conveyed to the plaintiffs, since the entry then made by the defendant; and that on receiving the balance, if any, which may remain due to the said carroll after deducting the rents and profits before mentioned, and the damages aforesaid, he be directed to convey to the plaintiffs a number of standard lots which shall be equal to the number of houses completed by the said morris and nicholson in pursuance of the contract of september, 1793; the said lots to be those on which the houses stand, which may have been completed, and if there be more than one house standing on the same standard lot, so that it may be necessary to convey lots not fully improved in order to make the quantity of ground equal to the superficial contents of the standard lots to be conveyed, then such standard lots are to be laid off by direction of the circuit court, in such manner as may be equitable and convenient; provided, that the ground imporved or built upon by morris and nicholson under the said contract, and re-entered upon by the defendant in may, 1797, be appropriated in the first instance as far as the same shall suffice or be necessary to make up the quantity of ground to be conveyed to the plaintiffs, but so appropriated that no lot shall be divided, unless it be necessary to convey part of a lot in order to make up the full quantity of six standard lots."
"4" "here, we think it was plainly the duty of the district court in the exercise of a sound discretion to have dismissed the petition remitting respondent if it was so advised to the initiation of a proceeding under chapter x, in which it may secure a reorganization which, after study and investigation appropriate to its corporate business structure and ownership, is found to be fair, equitable and feasible, and in the best interest of creditors."
"5" "if this doctrine be correct as to mere commercial transactions, it does not prevail in prize courts, in derogation of the rights of captors, when the interest of the claimant is only a debt, although supported by liens equitable and tacit, or legal and positive, even of the character of bottomry bonds, when not signified on the ship's papers at the time of her capture."
"6" "article 77 of treasury regulations 41 required every corporation to describe in its return 'all its intercorporate relationships with other corporations, with which it is affiliated,' and to 'furnish such information in relation thereto as will enable the commissioner of internal revenue to compute the amount of the tax properly due from each corporation on the basis of an equitable and lawful accounting.'"

"8" "equitable and legal jurisdictions have been wisely separated; and the soundest maxims of jurisprudence require each to be exercised in its appropriate sphere."
"9" "5       section 10, 25 u.s.c. § 677i, stated that when the final membership rolls had been published, the tribal business committee, representing the full-bloods, and the 'authorized representatives' of the mixed-bloods were to 'commence a division of the assets of the tribe that are then susceptible to equitable and practicable distribution.'"
"10" "9       in the federal courts such a blending of equitable and legal causes of action in one suit is not permissible under the process act of 1792, substantially re-enacted in the revised statutes, which declares that in suits in equity, in the circuit and district courts of the united states, the forms and modes of proceeding shall be according to the principles, rules, and usages which belong to courts of equity."
"11" "186       as the distinction between equitable and legal titles does not prevail in louisiana, where any just title is sufficient, and as no attachment can be sustained if the equitable title has passed out of the defendant in attachment before it was levied, it follows that an assignment of the equity, such as is contemplated by the court in the united states bank v."
"12" "rosenthal, dated october 28, 1882, and duly registered in clay county october 17, 1890; secondly, a quitclaim deed from olmsted and wife to rosenthal, dated october 31, 1882, registered in clay county november 12, 1906, quitclaiming all interest of the grantors in the lands described in the kope elias deed; and, thirdly, certain special proceedings in the superior court of alamance county, north carolina, taken by the executrix of swepson in the year 1884 for the sale of swepson's 'equitable and legal real estate,' which resulted in a deed made by order of the court from swepson's executrix to rufus y."

"14" "29       in pomeroy's equity jurisprudence (section 155) the author says, citing many cases: 'if one party obtains the legal title to property, not only by fraud or by violation of confidence or of fiduciary relations, but in any other unconscientious manner, so that he cannot equitably retain the property which really belongs to another, equity carries out its theory of a double ownership, equitable and legal, by impressing a constructive trust upon the property in favor of the one who is in good conscience entitled to it, and who is considered in equity as the beneficial owner.'"
"15" "3       the act of congress to which the decree refers authorized the secretary of war, with the advice of the counsel for the united states in that suit, 'to compromise, adjust, and settle the same upon such terms, as to amount and time of payment, as may be just and equitable, and best calculated to protect the interests of the government.'"
"16" "said county court shall be a court of record, having a seal with the coat of arms of the territory and 'county court, cochise county, arizona,' sunk or engraved thereon, and said county court shall have original, general, criminal, and civil jurisdiction, except as hereafter limited, and shall have equal concurrent common law, equitable, and statutory jurisdiction with the district courts in all cases."
"17" "by this act, therefore, the owners of the lands in question were deprived of the opportunity of being heard upon the question whether the apportionment as between them and the other land-owners, embraced within the original assessment district for the same improvement, was equitable and fair."
"18" "said board, in equalizing the valuation of property as listed and assessed in the different counties, shall consider the following classes of property separately: viz., personal property; railroad and telegraph property; lands, and town and city lots; and, upon such consideration, determine such rates of addition to or deduction from the listed or assessed valuation of each of said classes of property in each county, or to or from the aggregate assessed value of each of said classes in the state, as may be deemed by the board to be equitable and just,—such rates being in all cases even and not fractional; and such rates, as finally determined by said board, shall not be combined.'"
"19" "the fact, as alleged, that the amounts were paid to the complainant and accepted by him on the fraudulent representions of the officers that such amounts were all that were due, has no effect upon the question of the equitable and proper distribution of the fund that was, as a matter of fact, actually distributed."
"20" "186       as the distinction between equitable and legal titles does not prevail in louisiana, where any just title is sufficient, and as no attachment can be sustained if the equitable title has passed out of the defendant in attachment before it was levied, it follows that an assignment of the equity, such as is contemplated by the court in the united states bank v."
